##GAME RULES
Each player draws a character card (Vegan, Omnivore, Vegetarian or Paleo). Their character is kept secret til the end of the game. The game has 2 rounds (detailed below), the first in which they pick meals to put in front of them. The second in which they share meals  they picked, or eat them for themselves. This allows the player to 'bluff' by picking cards that aren't good for their character, when they actually intend to share that meal with another player.

###Rounds

1. Draft Meals - deal out all the cards, and everybody picks one, then passes the cards to their left. when you pick a card, play it in front of you. note: instead of picking a meal, you can 'fast' and trash the card, and get a bonus card from the bonus pile.
2. Invite Friends to a Meal - each player decides (secretly) which meals they'll eat, and which they will feed to friends (and get those points). 
3. After decisions are made, each player gets to use their bonus cards on the available meals, and some characters get to use their card tokens (omnivore, paleo).
